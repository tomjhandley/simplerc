Random Walks! A random walk is a stochastic simulation method that can
be used to model many phenomena, including animal movement and financial
markets. This repository contains a simple interface for simulating
Gaussian random walks.

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can clone the repository from this URL:
[simplerc](https://github.com/tomjhandley/simplerc). After unzipping: -
open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio - run `devtools::install()` to ensure
you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file).

## Usage

Use `simulate_walk` to simulate a Gaussian random walk. You can define
the length of the simulation in steps (`t`) and the mean (`mu`) and
standard deviation (`sigma`) of the distribution used in the simulation.

``` r
library(simplerc)
t <- 100
mu <- 0.5
sigma <- 2
walk <- simulate_walk(t, mu, sigma)
```

To visualize the simulation, use the `plot_walk` function with the
output of `simulate_walk`.

``` r
plot_walk(walk)
```

To estimate the parameters that were used for a simulation, use the
`fit_walk` function with the output from `simulate_walk`.

``` r
params <- fit_walk(walk)
params
#> $mu
#> [1] 0.2386638
#> 
#> $sigma
#> [1] 2.139589
```

For the example above, the estimated parameters of *μ* = 0.2386638 and
*σ* = 2.1395887 closely match the parameters used to generate the
simulation.
